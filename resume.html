        My father was a huge nerd; my technical learnings started early. At age
        seven I had access to our family computer: a 486 with QBASIC.  When we
        weren't playing on the 486, we were launching model rockets or rebuilding
        one of our old volkswagens.

        I have the pleasure to work in a field that I enjoy, and I'm always
        willing to get involved and help a company or individual reach their
        goals.  I've worked with numerous clients over the years in various
        capabilities-- most recently with TCB Courier, a San Francisco based
        company.
