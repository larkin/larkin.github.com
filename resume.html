    <p>
      My father was a huge nerd; my technical learnings started early. At age
      seven I had access to our family computer: a 486 with QBASIC.  When we
      weren't playing on the 486, we were launching model rockets or rebuilding
      one of our old volkswagens.

      I have the pleasure to work in a field that I enjoy, and I'm always
      willing to get involved and help a company or individual reach their
      goals.  I've worked with numerous clients over the years in various
      capabilities-- most recently with TCB Courier, a San Francisco based
      company.

  <div>
    <p>
      I use my keyboard more often than my trackpad and a CLI more often than
      a GUI.  I'm not afraid of using an IDE or learning new tools, I simply
      prefer tools that get out of my way and allow me be creative.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current toolchain is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mac OS X</li>
      <li>Chrome</li>
      <li>zsh</li>
      <li>TextMate2</li>
      <li>git</li>
